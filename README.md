# my-tailoring-database
This project is for storing the size of clothes for the use of tailoring shop. When customers come, they register their clothes size in registers but I want to digitalize this for them using a database in MERN-stack project.

This project contains two main directories, namely:
frontend
backend

Their is only one schema as of December 2 2024. And the project contains 5 apis. One for
creating a naaf(clothes size)
updating a naaf
getting one naaf
getting all naafs
and 
delete api
